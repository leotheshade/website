    <h1> Fighters</h1>
    <h4> Fighters are essential to your party, bringing heavy armor and sharp blades, these guys are the ones taking the hits and bringing the damage.
      <h3> Tanks</h3>
      <p> tanks are the ones who use skills to boost their defence, and taunt enemys into attacking them. Tanks are heavily armored fighters that have the stats necessary to soak up the damage. They let their allys do damage without having to worry about taking damage. They use spells that make enemys want to attack them instead of their allys, make it so when enemys attack them, it reflects damage, and increase their armor so they can take more damage. Here are all the fighters that can play tanks.</p>
      <h3> Guardian</h3>
      <p> Guardians are the anchor of any group of adventurers, providing leadership and protection for their allies. Combining durable armor with an impressive array of defensive skills, Guardians can remain standing after absorbing substantial amounts of physical damage from their enemies.</p>
      <h3> Paladin</h3>
      <p>The epitome of honor and valor, Paladins excel in martial combat while employing divine magic to enhance their abilities and strike down their enemies. By invoking both protective and healing magic, the Paladin can often survive battles that would crumble those of lesser resolve.</p>
      <h3> ShadowKnight</h3>
      <p>Shadowknights are malevolent crusaders who wreak fear, hate and despair upon all who would oppose them. In addition to their formidable martial art skills, Shadowknights conjure dark magic with which they can enhance their abilities and drain away the life force of their enemies.</p>
