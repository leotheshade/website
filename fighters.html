      <p> tanks are the ones who use skills to boost their defence, and taunt enemys into attacking them. Tanks are heavily armored fighters that have the stats necessary to soak up the damage. They let their allys do damage without having to worry about taking damage. They use spells that make enemys want to attack them instead of their allys, make it so when enemys attack them, it reflects damage, and increase their armor so they can take more damage. Here are all the fighters that can play tanks.</p>
