    <h1 id="title"> Everquest 2 class guide </h1>
    <h4 id="semi-title"> As the name says, this website is a guide on classes and what roles they play in a party.</h4>
<p> There are many types of "classes" or jobs in everquest 2. Each one has an impact on how your party takes on the challenges that face them. Most groups of new players form partys, not even thinking on how it will work out, and ends up going terrably. Classes are really fun to try out, to mix and match them in your party to make the ultimate fighting force. This site will help you see what classes do what and how they work with each other.</p>
  <p id="main-body">You may want to note that most of the combinations and specs are opinion based and you may have different preferances. The main goal of this site is to help you decide what class you want to play before you start playing. The choices will be impacted for if your alone, or in a group of friends. This also will help you decide what side you want to join in the start, good or bad. Of cource theres always the choice of neutral which in my opinion is the best choice</p>
